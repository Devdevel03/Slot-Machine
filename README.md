# Slot Machine

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient gambling slot machine system using JavaScript. Designed for seamless performance, the application ensures fair gameplay through a reliable random number generator (RNG) while delivering a smooth and intuitive user experience.The system provides a responsive interface, efficient mechanics, and offline functionality without relying on animations or internet connectivity. Built with scalability and reliability in mind, this slot machine offers a straightforward yet engaging gaming experience.

### Skills Learned
- Proficiency in JavaScript for developing interactive and functional slot machine systems.
- Experience with implementing a reliable random number generator (RNG) for fair gameplay.
- Understanding of UI design principles to create a simple yet effective user interface.
- Knowledge of managing game logic and state efficiently without animations.
- Debugging and troubleshooting to ensure smooth performance in an offline environment.

### Tools Used
- JavaScript – Core language for developing the contact management backend application.
- Node.js – Provides the runtime environment to execute JavaScript on the server-side, handling asynchronous operations efficiently.
- Express – A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used to build the application's routing and middleware.
- MongoDB – A NoSQL database used for storing and managing contact information with flexibility and scalability.
- Version Control (Git/GitHub) – Essential for tracking code changes, collaboration, and managing the development lifecycle.
- Testing & Debugging Tools (Mocha, Chai, Postman) – Employed to ensure the robustness, functionality, and performance of the backend services.
